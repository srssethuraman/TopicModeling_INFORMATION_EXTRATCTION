In linear algebra, the singular-value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. 
It is the generalization of the eigendecomposition of a positive semidefinite normal matrix (for example, a symmetric matrix with positive eigenvalues) to any m × n matrix via an extension of the polar decomposition. 
It has many useful applications in signal processing and statistics.
