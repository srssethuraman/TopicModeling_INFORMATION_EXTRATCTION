Warframe is a free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter video game developed and published by Digital Extremes. 
Originally released for Microsoft Windows in March 2013, it was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. 
In Warframe, players control members of the Tenno, a race of ancient warriors who have awoken from centuries of cryosleep to find themselves at war in a planetary system with different factions. 
The Tenno use their powered Warframes along with powerful weapons and abilities to complete missions. While many of the game's missions use procedurally-generated levels, newer updates have included large open world areas similar to other massively multiplayer online games. 
The game includes elements of shooting and melee games, parkour, and role-playing to allow players to advance their Tenno character with improved gear.
